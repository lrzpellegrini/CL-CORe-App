# The CL CORe App

CL CORe App is an *Artificial Vision* application for Android devices that can can classify objects from the CORe50 Dataset and **can learn how to classify object of new classes** by using the **AR1* Continual Learning Algorithm**.

All the inference and training tasks are made on-device, offline and without accelerators. The app actually supports ARM-v8 Android devices only, but we're planning on extending the support to ARM-v7 and Intel devices as well. There are no particular hardware requirements:  1GB+ RAM is recommended as well as 100 MB of free disk space.

You can download it from the release page.
